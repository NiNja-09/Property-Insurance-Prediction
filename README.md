# Predictive Modelling for Property Insurance

It focuses on predicting property insurance premiums, specifically targeting home insurance premiums. Property insurance plays a crucial role in safeguarding homeowners against financial loss due to unforeseen events such as natural disasters, accidents, or theft. Accurately predicting insurance premiums is essential for insurance companies to appropriately price their policies and for homeowners to make informed decisions about their coverage.


The dataset has been preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features to ensure compatibility with machine learning models.

The project employs machine learning techniques to predict home insurance premiums based on the provided dataset. The following steps were followed:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted an exploratory analysis of the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of features, identify correlations, and detect outliers.

2. Feature Engineering: Derived new features or transformed existing features to enhance the predictive power of the model. It include creating interaction terms, binning numerical variables, or encoding categorical variables appropriately.

3. Model Selection: Evaluated various machine learning algorithms suitable for regression tasks, such as decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, and XGBoost. Model selection was based on performance metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared.

4. Model Training: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to train the selected models. Employed techniques such as cross-validation to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.

5. Model Evaluation: Assessed the performance of trained models using evaluation metrics on the test dataset. Compared the performance of different models and selected the best-performing one for deployment.

### Conclusion
Property insurance premium prediction, particularly for home insurance, is a critical task that involves analyzing various factors to accurately estimate the cost of coverage. By leveraging machine learning techniques and appropriate data analysis, insurance companies can enhance their pricing strategies and offer competitive premiums while ensuring adequate coverage for homeowners. This project demonstrates the application of predictive modeling in the insurance domain and provides a framework for future research and development in this area.
